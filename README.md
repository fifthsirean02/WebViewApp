# WebViewApp
WebView App with Kotlin.

An Android App to create a WebWiew to display Web Page from local storage.

Inject Kotlin's custom functions in JavaScript to exchange message between JavaScript and Kotlin.

Re-assign the variable jObj containing a Window Object with a Kotlin's Object name (in String) by putting it under pre-defined ECMA6 function : `eval()` during assignment to make name (a String) into a String Template.

Use the newly obtained jObj to check whether the page is loaded in the App or Not.
